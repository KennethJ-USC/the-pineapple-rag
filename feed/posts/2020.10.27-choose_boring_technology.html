    <p><em>Editor's note: I'll be playing around with different sorts of 
    articles and commentary over the next few weeks. Your feedback and 
    engagement is more than appreciated. I'm starting with </em>Choose Boring Technology<em>
        because it addresses an important (but underappreciated) topic in an 
    entertaining, brief, and accessible format. It's certainly a favorite of
        mine. </em></p>
    
    <p> </p>
    
    <p><strong>Technology is complicated</strong>, and maintaining 
    technology over any noteworthy amount of time is even harder. Assuming 
    that digital systems naturally mature and stabilize over time is a 
    dangerous assumption. Digital systems consist of many things, most 
    importantly technologies, tools, people, and processes. This article 
    deals primarily with the first two.</p>
    
    <p>Importantly, decisions over which technologies to invest in - and 
    which to pass up on - are critical to the long-term stability of that 
    system. Indeed, Dan's primary audience are the individuals and teams 
    faced with these decisions.</p>
    
    <p>Embrace Boredom. "Boring" is not bad. Boring technology is often the 
    best tool for the job, precisely because it is boring. Boring 
    technologies tend to be…</p>
    
    <p>...Stable (PostgreSQL, Windows, inSite),<br>
    ...Interoperable/Standardized (email, Java),<br>
    ...Mature (.NET, Red Hat, Wikis),<br>
    ...Trustworthy (email, IRC).</p>
    
    <p>Sometimes, of course, you'll want to choose new technologies. 
    Innovative, exciting solutions can be the best choice. However, that 
    decisions ought to be the result of a calculation that considers the 
    costs and risks associated with technology that hasn't proven itself yet
        to be boring. Boring technology doesn't happen by accident.</p>
    
    <p> </p>
    
    <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Do you think this is relevant to Boeing ITDA? How so?</li>
        <li>What are some boring technologies you appreciate?</li>
        <li>Are there examples of areas/problem spaces/technologies where we 
    ought to explore newer options at the risk of added complexity? (e.g. 
    collaborative tools, like Mattermost)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Next week we'll take a look at the opposite sides of the problem:<em> when investment in new technologies makes the most sense</em>.</p>
