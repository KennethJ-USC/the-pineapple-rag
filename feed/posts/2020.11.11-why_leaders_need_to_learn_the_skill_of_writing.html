            <p>Why Leaders Need to Learn the Skill of Writing</p>
            <p>By Joe Byerly</p>

            
            <p>Link to original article: <a class="post-url" href="https://fromthegreennotebook.com/2020/10/03/why-leaders-need-to-learn-the-skill-of-writing/">Why Leaders Need to Learn the Skill of Writing</a> </p>

            <h4>Introduction:</h4>
            
            <p>Leaders often delegate written communication. This isn't surprising, 
            or necessarily a bad thing. What difference does it make if a 
            subordinate drafted the email when it is the content of the 
            communication and signature at the bottom that actually matters?</p>
            
            <p>Leaders are constantly making decisions about how to regulate their 
            time and energy, and writing for the sake of effective communication 
            consumes both of these resources in great quantities.This might not be 
            the whole story, however.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
            <p>"Recently, I worked for a senior Army leader who encouraged his 
            subordinate commanders to own their communications—meaning, write their 
            own emails. As I reflected on his guidance, I realized there are 
            benefits to communications ownership."</p>
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>So what are those benefits, and do they really make up for the time and effort?</p>
            
          </p>
            
            <h4>Editor's Commentary:</h4>
            
            <p>While the author takes inspiration for this article from his experiences in military leadership, I very much enjoyed mapping that perspective onto our work in enterprise IT. Frankly, it's not all that difficult.</p>
            
            <p>But that really shouldn't surprise us at all - especially in the context of this article. Both both types of  organizations are massive in terms of headcount, assets, and deliverables. Both organizations try to address fundamentally complex problems in shifting, geographically diverse environments.</p>
            
            <p>Of course, this applies to more than just organization leaders. It will never be too early to take ownership of your communications. I am in complete agreement with the author: effective written communication is a skill that can be learned and practiced.</p>
            
            <p>In fact, I'd argue that with respect to the technical, collaborative problems we face in our modern workplaces, effective communication is very often more important to the overall success of the project than the execution of the work itself at an individual level.</p>

            <p><strong>(Some) Questions:</strong></p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>How do you feel about your written communications? Do you even think about it?</li>
                <li>If you aren't confident with your written communication, do you ever plan on remedying that?</li>
                <li>Do you have any pet-peeves about the sort of communication discussed in this article?</li>
                <li>Have you ever written extensively outside of a classroom environment? Share your experiences!</li>
            </ol>

            technical excellence. Please share your feedback, and stay tuned! </em></p>
