                <p><strong>Editor's Commentary:</strong></p>
                
                <p>While the author focuses mostly on software engineering - and perhaps that is not the most relevant thing to enterprise IT writ large - this post provides valuable insights into areas other than pure development. For our purposes, I would like to highlight the software and IT strategy implications of this topic, most specifically with respect to decision-making in this space.</p>
                
                <p>We have a bias for writing our own code for the same reason that a new president always updates the oval office. We like to control our spaces. More specifically (and benevolently): we like to know we control a space. As the author puts it: "It is also more fun to design a new system, than it is to spend days learning about an existing system and augmenting it around the edges."</p>
                
                <p>It is difficult to know when to be an engineer, and when to be a businessman. It's hard to even figure out who ought to make that decision. Is it the developers themselves? Management? Death by committee?</p>
                
                <p>(If you guessed "Product Manager" or "Product Owner" - congratulations, you are way ahead of the curve.)</p>
                
                <p>The author tells us to ask some important questions when faced with challenging decisions.</p>
                
                <blockquote>
                <p>In these contexts, it makes sense to ask a few questions:</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li>What is the cost of writing this code? This question requires you to think about the medium and long term. Who will manage the code? What potential changes will need to be made?</li>
                <li>What other solutions are available? External tools often outweigh home grown solutions, even if they require work to customize to your use case. The monetary cost of many external tools often pales in comparison to the cost of an engineer’s salary.</li>
                <li>What biases do I have?: When you enjoy working on a certain problems, it means you’ll go after them even when it may not make much sense for the task at hand.</li>
                </ul>
                </blockquote>
                
                <p>For me, my biggest takeaway from this article was <strong>the need to be aware of our biases, even (and especially) in our decisions regarding IT and software development</strong>. Knowing yourself is good for you, and good for the business. Win - win!</p>
                
                <p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
                
                <ul>
                <li>Have you ever had to make or been a part of a decision regarding legacy vs. new software vs. off-the-shelf solution? Did you or your team regret the decision?</li>
                <li>Do you believe that there is a "bias to write code"? Do you believe it exists at Boeing?</li>
                </ul>
