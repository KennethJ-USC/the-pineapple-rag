<p><strong>Why Leaders Need to Learn the Skill of Writing</strong><br>
<em>By <strong>Joe Byerly</strong></em></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>

<p>Leaders often delegate written communication. This isn't surprising, 
or necessarily a bad thing. What difference does it make if a 
subordinate drafted the email when it is the content of the 
communication and signature at the bottom that actually matters?</p>

<p>Leaders are constantly making decisions about how to regulate their 
time and energy, and writing for the sake of effective communication 
consumes both of these resources in great quantities.This might not be 
the whole story, however.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Recently, I worked for a senior Army leader who encouraged his 
subordinate commanders to own their communicationsâ€”meaning, write their 
own emails. As I reflected on his guidance, I realized there are 
benefits to communications ownership."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what are those benefits, and do they really make up for the time and effort?</p>

<p><strong>Editor's Commentary:</strong></p>

<p>While the author takes inspiration for this article from his 
experiences in military leadership, I very much enjoyed mapping that 
perspective onto our work in enterprise IT. Frankly, it's not all that 
difficult.</p>

<p>But that really shouldn't surprise us at all - especially in the 
context of this article, and not because of Boeing's products or 
relationship with the military. Both organizations are massive in terms 
of headcount, assets, and deliverables. Both organizations try to 
address fundamentally complex problems in shifting, geographically 
diverse environments.</p>

<p>Of course, this applies to more than just our organizational leaders.
	It will never be too early to take ownership of your communications. I 
am in complete agreement with the author: effective written 
communication is a skill that can be learned and practiced.</p>

<p>In fact, I'd argue that with respect to the technical, collaborative problems we face in ITDA, <ins>effective
	communication is very often more important to the overall success of 
the project than the execution of the work itself at the individual 
level</ins><strong><ins>.</ins></strong></p>

<p><strong>(Some) Questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>How do you feel about your written communications? Do you even think about it?</li>
	<li>If you aren't confident with your written communication, do you ever plan on remedying that?</li>
	<li>Do you have any pet-peeves about the sort of communication discussed in this article?</li>
	<li>Have you ever written extensively outside of a classroom environment? Share your experiences!</li>
