<p><em>Editor's note: I'll be playing around with different sorts of 
articles and commentary over the next few weeks. Your feedback and 
engagement is more than appreciated. I'm starting with </em>Choose Boring Technology<em>
	because it addresses an important (but underappreciated) topic in an 
entertaining, brief, and accessible format. It's certainly a favorite of
	mine. </em></p>

<p><strong>Technology is complicated</strong>, and maintaining 
technology over any noteworthy amount of time is even harder. Assuming 
that digital systems naturally mature and stabilize over time is a 
dangerous assumption. Digital systems consist of many things, most 
importantly technologies, tools, people, and processes. This article 
deals primarily with the first two.</p>

<p>Importantly, decisions over which technologies to invest in - and 
which to pass up on - are critical to the long-term stability of that 
system. Indeed, Dan's primary audience are the individuals and teams 
faced with these decisions.</p>

<p>Embrace Boredom. "Boring" is not bad. Boring technology is often the 
best tool for the job, precisely because it is boring. Boring 
technologies tend to beâ€¦</p>

<p>...Stable (PostgreSQL, Windows, inSite),<br>
...Interoperable/Standardized (email, Java),<br>
...Mature (.NET, Red Hat, Wikis),<br>
...Trustworthy (email, IRC).</p>

<p>Sometimes, of course, you'll want to choose new technologies. 
Innovative, exciting solutions can be the best choice. However, that 
decisions ought to be the result of a calculation that considers the 
costs and risks associated with technology that hasn't proven itself yet
	to be boring. Boring technology doesn't happen by accident.</p>

<p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Do you think this is relevant to Boeing ITDA? How so?</li>
	<li>What are some boring technologies you appreciate?</li>
	<li>Are there examples of areas/problem spaces/technologies where we 
ought to explore newer options at the risk of added complexity? (e.g. 
collaborative tools, like Mattermost)</li>
</ul>

<p>Next week we'll take a look at the opposite sides of the problem:<em> when investment in new technologies makes the most sense</em>.</p>
